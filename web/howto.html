<h1>How to Play...!</h1>
<p>This game is a simple but shameless clone obviously based on the popular game "DoodleJump", just with
    different rules, a more refined and sophisticated artstyle and impressive graphics.</p>
<br>
<p>You may be asking yourself, how to master the complex mechanics of this masterpiece, but fear not! I will
    explain them for you.</p>
<br>
<p>This game is a classic case of "easy to learn, hard to master", but the persistent participant will be
    rewarded with deep and fulfilling storytelling</p>
<br>
<p>It is rumored, that true masters were able to control this simulation with just the power of their minds and
    thoughts. <b>For everyone else we recommend using the LEFT and RIGHT keys on your keyboard or if available
        control the game by leaning your device to either sides.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Your Quest will be satisfy, what ever gruesome Task the creators of this experience have put upon you in each
    level (<b>information available in your pause screen</b>) </p>
<br>
<p>If the game becomes to challenging, we understand that. Therefor we created the Pause-Screen, your place to
    Rest. <b>Access the mighty Pause-Screen by tapping (or clicking) anyore on the screen.</b> (Backside doesn't
    count)</b></p>
<br>
<p>There will be points, <b>you get 5 for every platform you touch the first time and lose 1 for every jump</b>
    It's easy as that.</p>
<br>
<p>Yeah we know, it's all fun and games... until someone dies! But dying is illegal in this game, so <b>if you
    die, you have to start over.</b></p>
<br>
<p>You will <b>die either by falling too fast or by hitting a "Deadly-Platform"(they are red), except you are
    protected... (you are blue)</b> you can get protected, by finding a rare booze item or <b>by touching a
    "Protection-Platform"</b> (also blue... coincidence?)</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, there are <b>"Boost-Platforms"(shiny bright yellow), they will let you do a dubble jump.</b></p>
